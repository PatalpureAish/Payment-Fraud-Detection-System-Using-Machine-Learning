# Payment-Fraud-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning
Payment fraud is a significant concern for businesses and financial institutions, leading to substantial financial losses.
Machine learning techniques provide a powerful tool for identifying fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in payment data.
This project aims to provide a practical implementation of payment fraud detection using machine learning. 
It utilizes a supervised learning approach where a model is trained on
historical payment transaction data with known fraudulent and legitimate examples.
The trained model can then be used to predict whether new, unseen transactions are fraudulent or legitimate.
